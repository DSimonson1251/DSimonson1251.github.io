## Week 8 Update 
What did you do last week?

I wrote out rough drafts of the Asgard function and I created new structures to keep track of the viking vs fire giant ratio for the 4 bags on the Midgard Location 
What do you plan to do this week?

I Plan to finish working on the Midgard function, adding a tracker for where the Valkyries are as well as making sure the viking and giant counts are kept properly up to date

Are there any impediments in your way?

Time is the biggest one, Personal travel is ramping up and my family might be moving again here shortly. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
Do not do the weekly update from Airport wifi, It will not go through all the way. 
I can also pace myself more and understand that some of these will take more than a week. The pressure is more from myself not from the course work schedule. 


## Week 7 Update 
What did you do last week?

Last week I spent time building out a generic turn structure. The game has 12-13 (depending on how you interpret the options) different actions a player can do on their turn. I added functions for each of these options. Most of these functions are empty currently, but the overall game undrstands a player gets 3 of these actions before the between turn mechanic starts. 

What do you plan to do this week?

I plan to start to fill out these functions. Not all of them will get done through this course due to time but the more common functions such as Midgard, Asgard and the Dwarven Forges. These all will require other game components to be added such as cards or tiles. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

At this point my skill as a coder is the only thing holding me back. I am having to learn on the fly and google much of what I am trying to do, while this is great because I am learning, it slows the process drastically. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
Last week was great, I think it was one of my most effective weeks through the class. I just need to keep this up moving forward. 


## Week 6 Update 
What did you do last week?

Last week I spent time finding the images I want to use for my game. A majority of this was taking clean pictures of the actual board game. Having the right scale was challenging so I had to measure and calculate a lot to ensure that it looks accurate to scale. I added all of these to the folder I am primarily using for this project trying to keep labels nice and clean. 

What do you plan to do this week?

This Week I will work on programing a turn structure and basic game play mechanics for a single player run through. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

The biggest impediment was not necessarily a bad thing this week. I had a job interview that occupied a majority of my time, I wanted to have as much prepped and reviewed for that, which is why I opted to go with a more simple week of uploading images. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
Now that I have some of the material uploaded It will be easier to add the rest since the scale has been established. 

## Week 5 Update 
What did you do last week?

Last week I played through he game a few times getting an idea of what components I want to focus on in the scope of this project.

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will set up a coding environment and start working on a requirements document to list out what needs to be done. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

None this week, I have ample time and this should be achievable in the time allotted. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
Reminding myself consistently that the goal is not a polished full game at the end is huge. I want to have something I am proud of but also want to ensure that I am able to get the rest of my school work done. 

## Week 4 Update 
What did you do last week?

Last week I polished off and submitted my proposal. I took the Time to also build out a schedule so I can stay on track week over week. 
I started to get more familiar with some of the concepts like Pygame that I will potentially be using and started reading up on tips.  

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will start by playing my game a few times and take notes on different components and how they might be written in coding logic. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

Convincing my wife to play with me might be a solid impediment, luckily the game can be played solo, its just not as much fun. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I need to be better overall at time management, being my last semester has made it so that I am not as focused as I should be. 
I need to do the postings earlier in the week and not leave so much until Friday. 

## Week 3 Update


What did you do last week?

Last week I worked with Professor Guinn to finalize my ideas and lock in what I plan to do my project on. 
I also commented on the remaining students posts and started working on my proposal.

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will finish up any loose ends to post the proposal before the due date. 
I will also lay out my calendar to have my set benchmarks with notifications to ensure I do not fall behind. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

No at this moment I have no blockage, I am in a spot where I just need to commit time and knock it out. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I think moving forward I need to be significantly more organized. With something as self paced as this course, I need to be the one to define the structure. If I can make sure that I know what needs to be done each week and follow that, the rest of the semester will be quite a bit easier. 
## Week 2 Update

What did you do last week?

This past week was spent brainstorming ideas for the project, trying to find something that I am both passionate about and something that will help teach me skills that will land me a job. I also spent time fixing my course schedule as there were numerous issues with my classes and I am trying to graduate in May. I also commented on one of my classmates proposals when reading through them to get ideas. 

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I need to make a decision and finalize my project proposal. I also will be commenting on 2 more of my classmates proposals.

Are there any impediments in your way?

The only impediments in my way are my own creativity. Whenever I have projects that are this broad and can really be anything I am paralyzed by indecision. I just need to commit to a project and run with it. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

The process last week was definitely not 100% what it needed to be, but as stated earlier there were definitely blockers in my way with my course schedule and the pressure to graduate. Now that I can commit the proper amount of time to this course I should be able to produce a working Project Proposal.
