## Week 2 Update

What did you do last week?

This past week was spent brainstorming ideas for the project, trying to find something that I am both passionate about and something that will help teach me skills that will land me a job. I also spent time fixing my course schedule as there were numerous issues with my classes and I am trying to graduate in May. I also commented on one of my classmates proposals when reading through them to get ideas. 

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I need to make a decision and finalize my project proposal. I also will be commenting on 2 more of my classmates proposals.

Are there any impediments in your way?

The only impediments in my way are my own creativity. Whenever I have projects that are this broad and can really be anything I am paralyzed by indecision. I just need to commit to a project and run with it. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

The process last week was definitely not 100% what it needed to be, but as stated earlier there were definitely blockers in my way with my course schedule and the pressure to graduate. Now that I can commit the proper amount of time to this course I should be able to produce a working Project Proposal.
